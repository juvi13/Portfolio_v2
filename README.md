# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command to install all the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Once the installation is complete, start the development server with this command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Your application should now be running, and you can view it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:9002`.
