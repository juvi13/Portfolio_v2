# **App Name**: Glassfolio

## Core Features:

- About Section: Display an 'About Me' section with a brief introduction and a map embed to show the location.
- Skill Tree: Implement a ribbon-style skill tree to visually showcase modern skills with matching UI icons. The arrangement should be interactive and intuitive.
- Experience Section: Detail professional experience, including company names, job titles, and durations with a focus on responsibilities and achievements.
- Qualification Section: List educational qualifications, certifications, and any relevant training programs completed. The certifications will link to verification pages, if available.
- Liquid Glass Effect: Apply a subtle liquid glass effect to certain UI elements, such as navigation bars and cards, to provide a modern, frosted appearance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grayish blue (#D5DBE8), subtly hinting at transparency without being overwhelming.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5) to enhance readability and keep with a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#B39DDB) to draw attention to key elements, like skill tree ribbons or call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, neutral feel. A single font is sufficient, since there isn't that much text to read on a portfolio page.
- Use flat, monochrome icons with rounded edges to align with Apple's design language.
- Implement a grid-based layout system with fluid containers and appropriate spacing to provide a responsive user experience.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations, such as fades and slides, to smoothly introduce new content.
